Hi,
I am Samatha Gajula from India.
I am pursuing my BTECH 2nd year in Computer science and engineering in Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University,
Anantapuram, India.
I had completed my three years diploma in Government polytechnic for minorities, Kurnool, India, in Computer Engineering.
I have grip on Web Development. I had done my internship in Web Development.
In my diploma I have learnt just basics of Java, python, javascript, DSA and even DBMS.
Currently, I am concentrating on Javascript, React and python.
This year, I am also trying to contribute to open source project which align with my interest and skills through GSoC 2025.
I hope I will get a chance to contribute myself to an open source and work for their betterment, I will try my level best.
